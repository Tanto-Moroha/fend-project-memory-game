## General information

Memory Game is a browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). Cards are arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## History of project

Memory Game Project is a part of Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program (know also as FEND).
Check at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com).

## Point of start

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. Shuffle function in JS file is also given (from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976).
You can find the starter code at [GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).

## Task

My task is to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
