# How to contribute

I will not accept pull requests for this project.
Of course you can develop this project on your own.

You can find the starter code at [GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).

The files in that repository are used as the starting point for all Udacity's students. Udacity wants students to write the majority of the code themselves, so pull requests (most likely) will _not_ be merged into the project.
